# Welcome to my first project

Throughout this project I will be using everything that I have learnt so far from Code Institue. This project will consist of HTML5, CSS3. (I may add abit of JS)

Please see [Milestone 1 for CodeInstuitute] (https://github.com/ShaneMuir/Milestone-1).

My site is for the purpose of my friends in my town who create their own EDM (Electronic Dance Music). I have decided to go outside the scope a little 
as this could potentially be a good boilerplate for when they are ready for a website designing.

## M3DL3Y

This website is designed to benefit my two friends from my hometown. They make and create music/entertainment under the band name 'M3DL3Y'. I wanted to showcase my 
skills that I have learnt so far by creating them a website that they would of not been able to create without the likes of a web builder. 

## Getting Started
