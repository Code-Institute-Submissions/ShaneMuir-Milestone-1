# Welcome to my first project

Throughout this project I will be using everything that I have learnt so far from Code Institue. This project will consist of HTML5, CSS3. (I may add abit of JS)

My site is for the purpose of my friends in my town who create their own EDM (Electronic Dance Music). I have decided to go outside the scope a little 
as this could potentially be a good boilerplate for when they are ready for a website designing.

## M3DL3Y

This website is designed to benefit my two friends from my hometown. They make and create music/entertainment under the band name 'M3DL3Y'. I wanted to showcase my 
skills that I have learnt so far by creating them a website that they would of not been able to create without the likes of a web builder.
