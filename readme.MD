# M3DL3Y

## My first Milestone Project

Throughout this project I will be using everything that I have learnt so far from Code Institue.
This project will consist of HTML5, CSS3. (I may add abit of JS)

My site is for the purpose of my friends in my town who create their own EDM (Electronic Dance Music).
I have decided to go outside the scope a little as this could potentially
be a good boilerplate for when they are ready for a website designing.

### M3DL3Y

This website is designed to benefit my two friends from my hometown. 
They make and create music/entertainment under the band name 'M3DL3Y'
I wanted to showcase my skills that I have learnt so far by creating them
a website that they would of not been able to create without the likes of a web builder.

### UX

The UX for this project is quite simple, it's mainly a static site for people to be able to
globally find the bands lastest info. New releases, keep up to date with the lastest informaiton,
video updates and so on. The colour shceme was requested by the band. they have always
been keen on a dark background with there main colour being purple.

Please note I have insisted for the contrast of the purple to be different as I advised it
will be more beneficial to have a higher contrast for readability purposes.

### Features 
```
*All the images for this project have been provided by the band, they create all their own artwork.

*Spotify and youtube 1 click follow buttons added for ease of ability to be able to follow the band on their
social platforms.

*Scroll to top button implemented for quick access to get back to top of the site.

*Jquery scroll ticker used to replace redundent marquee html element. 

*Nav - Bootstrap hamburger menu used for mobile/tablet. Bootstrap used for quick production of modern CSS
and use of their predefinded classes.

*Spotify and soundcloud used for the music page, rather then using mp3's and hard coding the songs onto the 
site I have made use of spotifys and soundclouds API embeds. This is for ease of access to their songs
instead of redirected the user to their platform site the user can have capability of listening to a song 
direct on the bands website.

*Videos section - All the videos used on this site are Youtube embeds. Yuotube used for ease of access to
view the bands videos.  Youtube follow button added + embed so the user does not have to be redirected 
from the bands site to see their youtube videos.

*Social buttons - I have added the bands social follow buttons to the footer of every page, this is aimed
at hoping to increase their following by traffic coming from the website.
I went with the approach of in sight in mind, if the socials icons are visible all the time in the footeer
as the user gets to the bottom of each page I assumed htis could improve social following.

*Gallery - Images optimized to reduce size to improve page laod speed. Fancy box plug in use djsut for
the purpose of this project. Fancy box was a improvment to improve the UX for the gallery when viewed by 
a visitor.

*Contact form - CSS used to add abit of interactivity to the contact page. I have used emailJS for the
purpose of this contact form.
```
#### Possible feature to implement 
```
*Pull soundcloud songs and spotify songs via API GET method, this way when the band update their 
platforms the updates can be pulled through via the API call rather then keep the embeds up to date.

*Youtube videos could be pulled through via the youtube API also. 

*Subscription form could be added to site. Mailchimp or other tech could be used to gather a
mailing list for the band to be able to do regular new updates to their subs.

*Instagram photos pull from their instagram account.
```
